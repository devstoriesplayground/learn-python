# Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as a list.
# The only difference is that tuples are immutable. Tuples once created cannot be modified.

# create a tuple
product = ('Microsoft', 'Xbox', 499.99)

# access element at index 0
print(product[0])   # Microsoft

# access element at index 1
print(product[1])   # Xbox
