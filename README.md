This repository contains a tutorial on the Python programming language. The tutorial is divided into several sections, each of which covers a different topic.


# WHAT IS PYTHON?

**Python** is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. It's widely used in various fields, including: Â  

* Data science and machine learning: Powerful libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn make Python a preferred choice for data analysis and model building.
* Web development: Frameworks like Django and Flask enable rapid web application development.
* Automation: Python scripts can automate repetitive tasks, saving time and effort.
* Scripting: It's used for system administration and scripting tasks.

Python's simplicity and large community support have contributed to its immense popularity.

**Get Started:**

**Installing Python**

The installation process varies slightly depending on your operating system.

**Windows**

* Visit the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
* Download the latest stable version: Choose the appropriate installer for your system (32-bit or 64-bit).
* Run the installer: Follow the on-screen instructions.
* Important: During installation, check the box that says "Add Python to PATH." This makes Python accessible from the command line.


**macOS**

* Check for pre-installed Python: macOS often comes with Python pre-installed, but it might be an older version. To check, open Terminal and type python --version or python3 --version.
* If you need a newer version or specific features: Download the latest version from https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/ and follow the installation instructions.


**Linux**

* Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed: Check the version by opening a terminal and typing python --version or python3 --version.
* To install a different version or specific packages: Use your distribution's package manager (e.g., apt, yum, dnf). For example, on Ubuntu, you can use sudo apt install python3.x (replace x with the desired version).


**Verifying the Installation**

Once the installation is complete, open a terminal or command prompt and type:

Bash
python --version

or

Bash
python3 --version


This will display the installed Python version if successful.

Note: 
If you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed, you might need to specify which version you want to use by typing python2 or python3. 
It's generally recommended to use Python 3 for new projects.
